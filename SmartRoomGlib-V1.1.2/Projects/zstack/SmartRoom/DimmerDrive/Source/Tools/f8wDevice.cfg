 *  Compiler command-line options used to define a TI Z-Stack ZigBee device.
 *  To move an option from here to the project file, comment out or delete the
 *  option from this file and enter it into the "Define Symbols" box under the
 *  Preprocessor tab of the C/C++ Compiler Project Options. New user defined
 *  options may be added to this file, as necessary.
 *
 *  Each macro is prefixed with '-D'. The entries are to be constructed as if
 *  they are to be on the compiler command line invocation (which they are).
 *
 *  NOTE: The RHS (Right-Hand-Side) must be quoted if there are embedded blanks.
 *        See the DEFAULT_KEY definition for an example.
